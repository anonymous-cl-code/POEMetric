# POEMetric

- We propose POEMetric, a comprehensive framework for poetry evaluation, covering basic instruction-following abilities, advanced creative abilities, and general appraisal. The code of POEMetric is in ....
- We curated a human poem dataset, carefully annotated with the forms (including meter and rhyme patterns), themes, and imagery. We released the public-domain human poems in POEMetric_human_poems_annotated.csv.
- We also designed an algorithm to automatically detect the formal patterns of poems. The code is in POEMetric_rule-based_form_accuracy.py.
